## Content

Help, my effect size is too large! Rarely is such a complaint heard in
statistical consultancy. Yet, unrealistically large effect estimates are an
artifact resulting from a combination of low power and selection by
significance. Conversely, high power is a necessary condition for valid
inference. In this workshop, I will illustrate with real-world examples the
failures when drawing conclusions from underpowered studies. I will introduce
how to calculate the power of a statistical test by computer simulation and
provide demonstrations of how to implement these simulations in R.


## Structure of the workshop

Each session will start with an introduction followed by hands-on exercises in
R. Hence, participants need a laptop with R installed. Participants are
furthermore encouraged to bring their own research questions or models they want
to run a power simulation for.


## Target audience

You will find the workshop useful, if you want to

* understand how to draw valid conclusions from data

* conduct power simulations based on substantial knowledge

* conduct power simulations for (complex) regression models


## Learning goal

By the end of the workshop, you will

* improve R competencies with respect to data and power simulation

* know how to judge reported effect sizes

* know how to plan empirical studies, especially with respect to power and
  sample size

* be aware of limitations of empirical studies


## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of

* R or another programming language like Python or Julia

* Statistics and drawing inferences from data


## Software requirements

Praticipants should have installed a recent version of

* R: https://cran.r-project.org/

and

* RStudio: https://posit.co/downloads/

or

* Another text editor (e.g., VIM https://www.vim.org/download.php) or IDE (e.g.,
  VScode https://code.visualstudio.com/download) of your choice
